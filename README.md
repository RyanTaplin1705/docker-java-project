# docker-java-project

This is a project which I am implementing with a colleague during our Wednesday afternoon personal development time.

I have been working on several enterprise level applications using layered architecture, with RESTful endpoints all in Java. 

The aim is to create a similar type of applications, but on a much smaller level, with less complex business cases. This will help get used to the ideas I have been implementing in the  business sense. Plus I came into the project late, after the initial setup has been done, so it would be good to have a basic understanding of this too.

## Technologies

First the project will involve the following

- Java 1.8 
- Testing
